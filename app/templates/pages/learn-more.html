        <h2 class="text-center mb-5">The Foundation of Open Content</h2>
        <p>
            For over 25 years, the open education movement has pursued its goal of increasing access to educational opportunities. Traditional Open Educational Resources (OER) revolutionized education by making materials freely available under open licenses, enabling collaboration and reuse worldwide. Generative AI now represents the next evolution in this journey, transitioning from merely sharing resources to dynamically creating educational content tailored to diverse needs and contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional OER, generative AI allows for the creation of "generative OER," tools designed to empower educators and learners to generate highly customized content. These advancements are critical to addressing barriers such as language, accessibility, and pedagogical diversity, making education more equitable and impactful.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-5 text-dark">How Generative AI Transforms Education</h2>
        <p class="text-dark">
            Generative AI facilitates the rapid drafting, revising, and remixing of educational materials, drastically reducing the time and expertise required for these processes. By leveraging open prompts and model weights, educators can adapt and localize resources to meet specific needs, from simplifying texts for language learners to creating interactive assessments.
        </p>
        <p class="text-dark">
            This capability extends the principles of open licensing into the realm of AI, ensuring that both the tools and the outputs of generative processes remain accessible, modifiable, and freely shared. By combining generative AI with traditional OER, we unlock new opportunities for innovation in teaching and learning.
