              <p>
                ADL (Assistant Description Language) is a formal language designed to systematically and standardizedly describe the behaviors, capabilities, style guidelines, and use cases of a chatbot based on Generative AI. Additionally, it incorporates an "educational resource" component. This means that it not only defines how the assistant operates but also includes relevant information about the author, usage rights, and modification history, among other aspects.
              </p>
              <p>
                ADL enables the formalized description of a customized assistant or AI model, structured as a YAML-formatted file. This format can be validated using specialized tools and is easily recognizable by machines.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                From a technical perspective, ADL is, therefore, a YAML file whose content is hierarchically structured through indentation. This approach ensures readability for humans while maintaining machine interpretability

        <div class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Using the File Created with ADL</h2>
          <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered shadow-sm">
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <h5 class="mb-3">In "My GPTs" within ChatGPT (OpenAI)</h5>
              <p>
                If the YAML file describing the assistant contains fewer than 8,000 characters, it can be inserted directly into the "Instructions" field when configuring a ChatGPT instance. It is advisable to copy the summary defined in the ADL into the "Description" field of the assistant within ChatGPT. In the "Conversation Starters" field, it is recommended to simply enter "/help" to serve as a brief initial guide.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the file exceeds 8,000 characters, then: The YAML file should be downloaded and added to the assistant's "Knowledge" documents. In the "Instructions" field, it is recommended to include a warning such as:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="blockquote border-start border-primary ps-4 my-4">
                <p class="mb-0 fst-italic">
                  "Answer all questions exclusively using the information contained in the YAML document stored in your knowledge. Strictly follow the instructions described in it, especially those related to the assistant's behavior and available tools. Do not use external information or make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated in the YAML document or in the documents available within your knowledge."
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="mb-0">
                This method ensures that the assistant operates in accordance with the specifications outlined in the ADL, without introducing information that is not present in the original file or its permitted knowledge base.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <h5 class="mb-3">As a "Custom Language Model" in OpenWebUI/OLLAMA</h5>
              <p class="mb-0">
                When creating a "language model" in OpenWebUI/OLLAMA, copy the complete content of the YAML file into the <em>prompt</em> (or "system prompt") that the platform requests. This way, the chatbot will adjust to the definition provided by the ADL. For local installations (e.g., with Ollama and OpenWebUI), follow the application instructions and paste the ADL in the designated location.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <h5 class="mb-3">Integration with ScolaIA DESK</h5>
              <p class="mb-0">
                When installing the ScolaIA DESK application, the YAML file describing the assistant can be imported through the administration panel. The application will validate the original structure, ensuring that it originates from the ScolaIA Lounge tool or a compatible ADL. In ScolaIA DESK, the assistant's structure is fully utilized, providing interactive panels that visually represent each section (commands, options, decorators, etc.).
