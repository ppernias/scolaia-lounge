    I am your AI assistant to help you get the most out of your study time.
    I have several tools that can help you break down the documents you need to study
    and master the subject as if you had discovered it yourself. I don't perform miracles
    or do the work for you, but with my help, you will make the most of every minute
    you dedicate to studying. Ready? Start by giving me a text you want to work with.
